# Menu of the Week - LMI Ericsson Athlone

This is just a hobby project which scrapes the weekly menu updated in [ericssondining.ie](https://www.ericssondining.ie/post/weekly-daily-menu-week-beginning-12-02-2024) and sends the picture in a telegram group.

I set this up initially on my server which runs [HomeAssistant](https://github.com/n00bcodr/homeassistant/) but moved it to GitHub and am using GitHub actions.
